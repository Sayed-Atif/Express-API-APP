This API-APP consist of  3 data models, public file css3, 3 routes handlers, , views nd the server file.
Here for styling the home page I used CSS3 and for the template engine I used the ejs. 
In this express API-APP the three data set of tasks, fruits and vegitables are comming from the server to the browser in the json format.
To access the home page of Application you need to use the URL http://localhost:8000/Home in your browser.
To access the API data for the fruits data model you need to use the URL http://localhost:8000/api/fruits in your browser.
To access the API data for the vegitables data model you need to use the URL http://localhost:8000/api/vegitables in your browser.

Thank you,
